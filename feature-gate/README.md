# Feature Gate Program

This program serves to manage new features on Solana.

It serves two main purposes: queuing new features for activation and revoking
features that are already queued and pending activation.

More information & documentation will follow as this program matures, but you
can follow the discussions
[here](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/72)!
