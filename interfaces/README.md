# SPL Interfaces

A collection of Solana Program Interfaces, as defined by one or more sRFC workflows.

These interfaces can be implemented by programs who wish to customize the functionality these interfaces represent.

Each interface contains (at least) two crates:

- `interface`: The interface itself, which can be implemented by on-chain programs
- `example`: An example of how to implement the interface
